#### Challenge2
   Challenge2 is about writing a program that takes the speed of the car as input and returns "Ok" if the speed is less than 70km/h. If the speed is above the speed limit it should give the driver one demerit point and print total number of points. If the driver gets more than 12points, the function should print "License suspended".
